Completed
- Change first node (initial node) parent node to itself not (0,0) for plotting reasons
- Make sure <= not <: abs(child_theta - th_goal) <= theta_threshold
- Fix rounding for visited_matrix i,j,k logic, may not need anymore
- Round child node coordinates to nearest half to reduce node search
- Dissolve mark_region_visited() function
- Not needed:  May add condition if theta is < 0, add 360 degrees
- Verify map_obstacle_freespace_matrix() logic
- Fix wall borders
- Change name of cost_to_come function to total cost
- Check on triangle case
- Fix cost logic & add Parent C2C to dictionaries 
    #new_cost_to_come = round(cost_of_action + parent_cost_to_come, 1) ##### ISSUE C2C, TOTALCOST
     #IF NEWTOTAL COST < CHILDSTOREDTOTAL COST
     
Additional Tasks
- Verify theta check
