- compute new child node x, y, theta
- check if child is in obstacle space, may need to modify this code
-> Can I still use pixel == -1 method?
-> If so, I need to round the value somehow using int()


- update visited_matrix, visited_queue, and open_dict with appropriate cost values

- check if goal has been reached using 1.5 distance and 30 degree threshold values

Problems 
- wrong x,y, do not expect 15.0, 11.0 for each child
- each child should be a new node in open_dict but it's not
