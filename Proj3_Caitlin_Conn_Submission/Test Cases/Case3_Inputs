Caitlin Conn Project 3 Phase 1 Case 3:

Enter robot radius (ex. 5): 5
Robot Radius: 5

Enter robot clearance (ex. 5): 5
Robot Clearance: 5

Enter start node's x coordinate. x coordinate can range from 0 to 299: 10
Enter start node's y coordinate. y coordinate can range from 0 to 124: 11
Enter the orientation of the robot at the start point in degrees: 0
Start node x-coordinate: 10
Start node y-coordinate: 11

Enter goal node's x coordinate. x coordinate can range from 0 to 299: 150
Enter goal node's y coordinate. y coordinate can range from 0 to 124: 15
Enter the orientation of the robot at the goal point in degrees: 30
Goal node x-coordinate: 150
Goal node y-coordinate: 15

Enter step size of the robot in units (1 <= L <= 10): 10
Step Size L: 10
